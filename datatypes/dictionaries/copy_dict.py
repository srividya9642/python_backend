# Copy Dictionaries :
''' we cannot copy a dictionary simply by typing dict2 = dict1, because; dict2 will only be a 
reference to dict1, and changes made in dict1 will automatically also be made in dict2.

There are ways to make a copy, one way is to use the built-in dictionary method copy().'''

thisdict = {
    'brand' : ' ford',
    'model' : 'mustang',
    'year' : 1964
}
mydict = thisdict.copy()
print(mydict)

# Another way to make a copy is to use the built-in function dict().

thisdict = {
    'brand' : 'ford',
    'model' : 'mustang',
    'year' : 1964
}

mydict = dict(thisdict)
print(mydict)
